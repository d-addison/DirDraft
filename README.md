## Overview
The Folder Structure Visualization and Restructuring Utility is a cross-platform tool designed to help users visualize and reorganize their folder structures efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to drag and drop folders, preview changes, and execute the restructuring operations in a single step.

## Goals
- Provide a clear and intuitive visualization of folder structures
- Enable users to easily reorganize folders using drag-and-drop functionality
- Offer a range of features to enhance the folder management experience
- Support cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Linux)

## Features
1. **Folder Structure Visualization**
   - Display folder structures in a tree-like view
   - Show folder and file details (e.g., name, size, modification date)
   - Provide customizable visualization options (color schemes, icon sets, themes)

2. **Drag-and-Drop Restructuring**
   - Allow users to drag and drop folders to reorganize the structure
   - Provide visual feedback during the drag-and-drop process
   - Update the underlying data structure in real-time

3. **Preview and Comparison**
   - Enable users to preview the changes before applying them
   - Provide a side-by-side comparison view of the original and modified structures
   - Highlight differences (moved, renamed, or deleted folders and files)

4. **Undo and Redo**
   - Implement undo and redo functionality to revert or reapply changes
   - Maintain a history of modifications made by the user

5. **Filtering and Searching**
   - Allow users to filter the view based on file types, sizes, or modification dates
   - Provide a search functionality to locate specific files or folders

6. **Disk Space Analysis**
   - Integrate disk space analysis features similar to WinDirStat
   - Display disk space consumption using visual representations (treemaps, pie charts)
   - Identify and manage large files or folders

7. **Batch Operations**
   - Support batch operations on multiple selected folders or files
   - Implement mass renaming, copying, or moving of selected items

8. **Integration with Cloud Storage**
   - Extend the utility to support popular cloud storage services
   - Enable users to visualize and restructure cloud folder structures

9. **Folder Templates and Presets**
   - Provide predefined folder structure templates for common use cases
   - Allow users to create and save custom folder structure presets

10. **Collaboration and Sharing**
    - Implement features for collaboration and sharing of folder structures
    - Allow exporting and importing of folder structure configurations
    - Provide options to generate shareable links or invite others

11. **Version Control and Backup**
    - Integrate version control capabilities to track changes over time
    - Automatically create backups before applying significant changes
    - Allow reverting to previous versions of the structure

12. **Cross-Platform Synchronization**
    - Enable synchronization of folder structures across multiple devices or platforms
    - Automatically detect and merge changes made on different devices

## Development Phases

### Phase 3: Preview, Comparison, and Undo/Redo
- Develop the preview and comparison feature
- Implement undo and redo functionality
- Enhance the user interface with these features

### Phase 4: Filtering, Searching, and Disk Space Analysis
- Integrate filtering options based on file types, sizes, or modification dates
- Implement search functionality to locate files or folders
- Add disk space analysis features and visual representations

### Phase 5: Batch Operations and Cloud Storage Integration
- Implement batch operations for multiple selected items
- Extend the utility to support popular cloud storage services
- Enable visualization and restructuring of cloud folder structures

### Phase 6: Templates, Presets, and Collaboration
- Develop predefined folder structure templates and preset functionality
